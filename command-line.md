A) Explain the command line
The command line interface (CLI) is a way of interacting with the computer sysytem by means of commands which take the form of lines of text. 

The CLI is a version of a system known as a Character User Interface (CUI). The CUI contrasts with the more commonly-used Graphical User Interface (GUI) that most computer users would be accustomed to using. MS-DOS is an example of a CUI, while Micorsoft Windows is an exmaple of a GUI. 

While a CUI can appear cumbersome and difficult to use, it does have some major advantages over a GUI. These include speed, as only a few lines may be needed to execute tasks that would take longer in a GUi, and more control over both file and operating systems.
